A sidebar widget to connect to the council data service provided by beBirmingham and Be Vocal

== Description ==

If you run a blog about a neighbourhood in Birmingham in the UK this plugin will provide you with either a sidebar widget or a full page which shows
who your local public servants are and how to contact them.  It means you no longer need to worry about keeping this information updated. 

If your blog patch covers a number of neighbourhoods you can create a separate widget for each. 

At the moment the information includes:  Local police officers, local ward support officers, local neighbourhood managers (if you have one) councilors
and relevant ward related meetings.   It's partly the answer to the problem of useful information being hedl by a range of organisations - which is
why the database which drives the widget is looked after by the local strategic partnership

This idea popped into the head Nick Booth of Podnosh as part of the Timely Information for Citizens project he was working on with Dave Harte, who was
then working at Digital Birmingham.

It was produced through the brilliant cooperation of Be Birmingham and West Midlands police, with coding by Chris Ivens of Joltbox.
